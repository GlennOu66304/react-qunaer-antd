## A.extra webpack log output:
Mainly caused by the react-script version, I tried npm run eject issue, tried to modify some changes in the webpack config, but that is way more complex for me. So I decided to downgrade my react-script version.

By downgrading the creat-react-app's react version to 17.0.1, react-dom to ^17.0.1, then react-script version to 4.0.1 in the package.json, remove the node modules. run npm i, then npm start can fix the extra webpack lout issue
